# Summary
This repository comprises a diverse collection of programming exercises, exams ans source code written in C++. Below is a summarized overview of the principal components present within the repository:

## Exams
The "Exams" directory contains subdirectories representing different exam exercises. Each subdirectory is named after the specific exercise, and within each subdirectory, you can find relevant PDF files and accompanying source code files. The exams included are as follows:

- `lab-1_CarteFedelta`: Contains a PDF file (`lab-180618.pdf`) and source code files (`sc_2018-06-18`) related to a lab exercise on loyalty cards.
- `lab-2_SocialNetwork`: Includes a PDF file (`lab-180719.pdf`) and source code files (`sc_2018-07-19`) related to a lab exercise on social networks.
- `lab-3_InvertedIndex`: Contains a PDF file (`lab-180914.pdf`) and source code files (`lab_2018-09-14`) related to a lab exercise on inverted indexes.
- `lab-4_Scala40`: Includes a PDF file (`lab-190205.pdf`) and source code files (`sc_2019-02-05`) related to a lab exercise on a card game called "Scala 40."
- `lab-5_Punti-Interesse`: Contains a PDF file (`lab-190627.pdf`) and source code files (`sc_2019-06-27`) related to a lab exercise on points of interest.
- `lab-6_Agenda`: Includes a PDF file (`lab-210917.pdf`) and source code files (`sc_2021-09-17`) related to a lab exercise on an agenda.

## Exercises
The "Exercises" directory consists of subdirectories categorized by different topics and related source code files. The subdirectories are as follows:

- `DataStructures`: Contains subdirectories related to different data structures exercises, such as binary search trees, graphs, linked lists, and queues.
- `SourceCode_by_Topic`: Includes source code files categorized by topics such as binary search trees, comparisons, graphs, linked lists, queues, recursion, and trees. The files are named after specific exercises.

## Makefile
The top-level directory includes a `Makefile`, which is a build automation script used to compile and build the source code files.
